I am  a recent [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) graduate, and currently a research assistant at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Department of Computer Science. My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Data Mining with mental health, behavioral, and societal applications. 

The ubiquity of the internet has enabled the collection of vast datasets that encapsulate the complexities of human behavior and society. My primary research objective is to develop tools to uncover and understand these intricate dynamics by analyzing large-scale, unstructured data. This interdisciplinary endeavor draws from my academic background in psychology from Peking University, coupled with a strong foundation in computer science acquired through coursework and 4 independent research projects. 

During my academic journey, I have had the privilege of collaborating with esteemed professors, notably my past and current advisor,  [Prof. Huan Liu](https://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/) at Arizona State University, [Prof. Talayeh Aledavood](https://talayeh.xyz/) at Aalto University, [Prof. Keith Burghardt](https://www.kburg.co/) and [Prof. Kristina Lerman](https://www.isi.edu/people-lerman/) at University of Southern California and [Prof. Gary Hsieh](https://faculty.washington.edu/garyhs/#research) at University of Washington.


# Research Project
## Towards Understanding Depression through Music Preferences üéµ
The prevalence of Mental Health disorders has been an escalating concern worldwide. In this work, I aimed to quantify and compare music preferences between individuals with and without depression, a task challenging to address through traditional laboratory experiments.

To accomplish this, I developed a methodology that examined music from musical, lyrical, and network perspectives. First, I scraped songs‚Äô musical features such as danceability and acousticness through the Spotify API and conducted statistical analysis for them. Second, leveraging Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), I compared the topic and language use of lyric differences between music favored by individuals diagnosed with and without depression. To understand this question above individual levels, I also conducted a Network Analysis applying community detection algorithms to examine the network relationships of these two groups. My result reveals a possible echo-chamber effect, where the musical choices of depressed individuals may inadvertently reinforce depressive moods. 

This work under the guidance of [Prof. Huan Liu](https://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/) from Arizona State University, has been submitted to [WWW‚Äô24](https://www2024.thewebconf.org/) with me as the first author. 

## Analyzing Users‚Äô Evaluation about Mental Health Apps at Scale üì±
During the past few years, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a dramatic increase in the prevalence of mental illness. Nearly 20% of adults are experiencing a mental illness in 2022. While the needs for treatment and intervention of mental health are high, the available resources for mental health are insufficient and inadequate all over the world: the traditional mental health costs are high and need long wait times. Against this backdrop, digital mental health tools present an accessible and affordable solution to address the current treatment gap. 

However, mental health apps, as a new category in the app market, lack solid user experience research, and usability evaluation. To address this gap, I developed a methodology to analyze user reviews of over 500 mental health apps from Google Play and App Store. Through machine learning techniques, including BERT-based classification, clustering, and topic modeling, I identified user concerns and perspectives, enhancing mental health app usability and effectiveness. This research has the potential to significantly contribute to improving mental health treatment.

## BERT-Based Multi-task Approach for Violence Detection üí£
Hate speech can lead to real-world harm, including violence, discrimination, and social division. Understanding its dynamics helps in creating safer online spaces, preventing offline harm, and enhancing platform accountability. In this context, my work, advised by [Prof. Keith Burghardt](https://www.kburg.co/) and [Prof. Kristina Lerman](https://www.isi.edu/people-lerman/) at USC, focuses on the developing violence detection tools and understanding the radicalization of violence. My work involved fine-tuning deep learning-based NLP models, such as BERT and Roberta, for violence detection. I also developed a novel multi-task architecture to address label disagreements between annotators and a multi-label classification approach for hate-speech-related labels. These innovations resulted in a state-of-the-art violence classifier and a hate-speech-related multi-label classifier, outperforming 20% than previous research using SVM and LSTM. My research has practical implications for creating safer online spaces and enhancing platform accountability, and it is currently being prepared for submission to [NAACL'24](https://2024.naacl.org/), with me as the first author.

## Exploring the Relationship between Emotion and Engagement üëç

In a collaborative project supervised by [Prof. Gary Hsieh](https://faculty.washington.edu/garyhs/#research) at University of Washington, I explored the social engagement dynamics related to emotion sharing on social media platforms. We uncovered intriguing patterns through data scraping and statistical analysis, such as positive posts receiving more likes and negative posts generating more replies. A survey complemented these findings, shedding light on the underlying reasons for these trends. This project marked my first foray into extensive literature review and academic writing and has been submitted to [CSCW 2024](https://cscw.acm.org/2023/), with me as the first author.
