As a Bachelor of Science in Psychology, I often encounter the heuristic assumption that my expertise is non-technical, particularly in the realms of computer science and mathematics. This perception has led to several rejections in my academic and professional pursuits, which, while a little bit disappointing, have fueled my determination to break stereotypesðŸ¤“.

Actually, I have built solid math and coding skills through my coursework and past research experience. Thanks to my talented brain in math, I got the highest score in calculus course (among 150+ students major in computer science, physics, biology and psychology). Thanks for the well-crafted documentation and clear online tutorials, I have acquired a diverse range of coding skills. I've harnessed these skills to develop innovative models and algorithms in my researchðŸ¤©.

Overall, my technical skill set encompasses the following areas:

### Python ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, NetworkX, Matplotlib
- Applications: Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Data Mining, Data Scraping, Network Analysis

### R ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- Packages: ggplot2, dplyr, shiny, randomForest
- Applications: Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization

### MATLAB ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- Features: Signal Processing, Image Processing
- Applications: EEG Signal Processing, Data Visualization
